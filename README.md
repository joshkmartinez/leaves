### A dead-simple bot that deletes user's messages once they leave your discord server. No configuration required.
#### [Invite](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=767559534167851008&permissions=26624&scope=bot)  - [Support Server](https://discord.gg/4xCUX7ddgy)  
Prefix: `leaves`  
Commands:

- `leaves help` - Lists all of the bot's commands.
- `leaves ping` - Pings the bot.

### Just give Leaves `MANAGE_MESSAGE` permissions in every channel that you would like it to operate it, and that's it! Leaves will automatically delete a user's messages once they leave your server.
